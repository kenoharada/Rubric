An essay at this level fully accomplishes all of the following:\par - addresses the topic and task thoroughly, with well-developed, specific, and relevant explanations, exemplifications, and details that directly support the position; examples are clearly explained, logically connected to the argument, and demonstrate insight rather than mere \textcolor{rpTypeEvidence}{illustration} - even \textcolor{rpTypeRule}{if} an example is unconventional or imperfectly factual, it is treated with analytical depth and purposefully tied to the claim; minor factual inaccuracies (\textcolor{rpTypeEvidence}{e.g.}, misnamed individuals, exaggerated statistics) are acceptable only \textcolor{rpTypeRule}{if} they are not central to the argument and do not undermine the credibility of the analysis\par - is clearly and logically organized, with smooth progression and strong \textcolor{rpTypeWriting}{coherence} between ideas; \textcolor{rpTypeWriting}{transition}s are natural, structure is purposeful, and there is no significant redundancy, \textcolor{rpTypeEvidence}{digression}, or unclear connections - minor \textcolor{rpTypeWriting}{organization}al imperfections (\textcolor{rpTypeEvidence}{e.g.}, repetitive phrasing or slightly awkward \textcolor{rpTypeWriting}{transition}s) are acceptable \textcolor{rpTypeRule}{if} the overall argument flows logically and the paragraphing supports the development of ideas\par - displays consistent and effective facility in the use of language, demonstrating varied and sophisticated sentence structures and a broad, precise vocabulary appropriate to the academic context; word choice enhances clarity and impact - occasional non-standard word forms, mis\textcolor{rpTypeWriting}{spelling}s, or idiomatic imprecisions are acceptable only \textcolor{rpTypeRule}{if} they are rare, isolated, and do not impede comprehension or undermine the writer's control; errors must not be systematic or frequent enough to require interpretive effort\par - contains only rare, minor errors in \textcolor{rpTypeWriting}{grammar}, word form, or idiomatic usage that are inconsequential to understanding and do not distract from the message; \textcolor{rpTypeWriting}{spelling} and \textcolor{rpTypeWriting}{punctuation} are consistently accurate - errors must not be predictable, recurring, or pervasive enough to suggest a lack of language proficiency; \textcolor{rpTypeRule}{if} errors appear frequently (\textcolor{rpTypeEvidence}{e.g.}, consistent mis\textcolor{rpTypeWriting}{spelling} of common words like "nowdays," "donot," "belive"), the essay cannot qualify for Score 3, regardless of content strength\par \par ... [1 lines omitted] ...\par An essay at this level is marked by one or more of the following:\par - addresses the topic and task with sufficient development, but explanations, examples, or details may be somewhat general, inconsistently specific, or only partially developed; the argument is present but lacks depth, precision, or analytical insight in places; examples may be relevant but are not fully explained or are loosely tied to the claim - even \textcolor{rpTypeRule}{if} examples are flawed, fictional, or oversimplified, they are recognized as intended \textcolor{rpTypeEvidence}{illustration}s and are not dismissed as invalid \textcolor{rpTypeRule}{if} they serve a clear rhetorical purpose; factual inaccuracies or imprecise examples are acceptable \textcolor{rpTypeRule}{if} they do not dominate the argument or mislead the reader's understanding of the position\par - shows adequate \textcolor{rpTypeWriting}{organization} and logical progression, with clear overall structure, but may contain minor lapses in \textcolor{rpTypeWriting}{coherence}, \textcolor{rpTypeWriting}{transition}al awkwardness, or repetitive points that do not undermine the central argument; ideas are connected but not always with sophistication - redundancy or phrasing \textcolor{rpTypeEvidence}{repetition} is acceptable \textcolor{rpTypeRule}{if} the core logic remains intact and paragraphing provides discernible structure\par - demonstrates partial control of language: sentence structures are generally varied but may include occasional awkwardness, simplicity, or overuse of basic constructions; vocabulary is adequate and mostly appropriate, though sometimes repetitive, imprecise, or colloquial - frequent \textcolor{rpTypeWriting}{spelling}, \textcolor{rpTypeWriting}{grammar}, or word form errors are acceptable \textcolor{rpTypeRule}{if} they are predictable (\textcolor{rpTypeEvidence}{e.g.}, "nowdays," "donot," "belive," "Eddison," "popolation"), systematic but not severe, and do not consistently obscure meaning or require substantial reinterpretation; the writer's intent and position remain clearly discernible despite these errors\par - contains noticeable errors in \textcolor{rpTypeWriting}{spelling}, \textcolor{rpTypeWriting}{punctuation}, or syntax that affect tone or clarity but do not prevent the reader from understanding the writer's intent and position; errors must be frequent enough to be systematic but not so severe as to make comprehension difficult without contextual inference - \textcolor{rpTypeRule}{if} errors are pervasive (\textcolor{rpTypeEvidence}{e.g.}, recurring in nearly every sentence), the essay should not be rated higher than Score 2, even \textcolor{rpTypeRule}{if} the content is well-developed\par \par ... [1 lines omitted] ...\par An essay at this level is marked by one or more of the following:\par - shows minimal or inadequate development of ideas in response to the task; explanations, examples, or details are missing, \textcolor{rpTypeEvidence}{irrelevant}, overly general, fabricated without purpose, or fail to meaningfully support the position; the response may misinterpret the prompt or avoid addressing it directly - fabricated examples are only acceptable \textcolor{rpTypeRule}{if} they are used deliberately and analyzed; otherwise, their presence without analysis or relevance signals Score 1\par - lacks clear \textcolor{rpTypeWriting}{organization} or logical progression; ideas are disjointed, poorly connected, or presented in a confusing sequence with no discernible structure; paragraphing is absent or arbitrary - the absence of paragraphing alone is not sufficient for Score 1 \textcolor{rpTypeRule}{if} ideas are otherwise logically grouped\par - contains frequent and severe errors in sentence structure, word form, \textcolor{rpTypeWriting}{spelling}, and usage that consistently obscure meaning and hinder communication; the language is often unintelligible or requires substantial interpretation to discern intent - errors must be pervasive and systemic enough to make comprehension difficult even with contextual inference\par - demonstrates a very limited or inappropriate use of vocabulary and syntactic structures, making the response difficult to follow even \textcolor{rpTypeRule}{when} content is partially understandable - vocabulary must be consistently primitive or misused, not merely imprecise\par - may include nonsensical examples, factual distortions, or persistent grammatical breakdowns that undermine credibility and prevent the reader from engaging with the argument - isolated factual inaccuracies are not grounds for Score 1 \textcolor{rpTypeRule}{if} the argument otherwise holds together
