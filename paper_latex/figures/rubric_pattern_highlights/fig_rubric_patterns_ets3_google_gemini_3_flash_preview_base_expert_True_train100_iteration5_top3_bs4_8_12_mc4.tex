An essay at this level largely accomplishes all of the following:\par - addresses the topic and task well, providing specific, relevant, and sophisticated details or examples; an unfinished conclusion or mechanical errors (\textcolor{rpTypeWriting}{spelling}, typos, word form) do not automatically disqualify an essay \textcolor{rpTypeRule}{if} the preceding development is thorough and the logic is compelling\par - is well organized and well developed, with a clear and often complex progression of ideas that remains focused on the prompt\par - displays unity and \textcolor{rpTypeWriting}{coherence}; the argument is sustained throughout the response, and any minor errors do not interfere with the reader's ability to follow sophisticated reasoning\par - displays facility in the use of language, demonstrating syntactic variety and range of vocabulary; even \textcolor{rpTypeRule}{if} there is a noticeable "accumulation" of surface-level errors (\textcolor{rpTypeEvidence}{e.g.}, "patern," "nowdays," "thining," "Eddison"), the essay remains at this level \textcolor{rpTypeRule}{if} the writer maintains a consistent rhythm and control of complex sentence structures\par \par ... [2 lines omitted] ...\par - addresses the topic and task using somewhat developed explanations or details, but the argument may be formulaic, generic, or rely on repetitive logic rather than sophisticated development\par - displays unity and \textcolor{rpTypeWriting}{coherence}, but the connection of ideas is occasionally obscured, or the essay moves mechanically from one point to another without deep exploration\par - demonstrates inconsistent facility in sentence formation; while the meaning is generally clear, frequent errors in \textcolor{rpTypeWriting}{grammar}, \textcolor{rpTypeWriting}{spelling}, or word choice (\textcolor{rpTypeEvidence}{e.g.}, "more risk more yield," "out of different reasons," "there were made several surveys") indicate a lack of sustained control over the language or a reliance on overly simple sentence structures\par - may stray into \textcolor{rpTypeEvidence}{irrelevant} \textcolor{rpTypeEvidence}{digression}s, personal \textcolor{rpTypeEvidence}{anecdote}s that provide only tangential support, or meta-commentary about the test-taking process\par \par ... [2 lines omitted] ...\par - limited or superficial development in response to the topic; the essay may be very short, lose focus on keywords, or provide confusing/insufficient exemplification\par - inadequate \textcolor{rpTypeWriting}{organization} or connection of ideas; the essay may struggle to move beyond a few basic thoughts or may end abruptly mid-sentence (\textcolor{rpTypeEvidence}{e.g.}, "maybe we would be who")\par - a pervasive accumulation of errors in sentence structure, usage, \textcolor{rpTypeWriting}{spelling}, and \textcolor{rpTypeWriting}{grammar} (\textcolor{rpTypeEvidence}{e.g.}, "it can be happen," "how I can happy," "rock question," "anwear") that seriously interrupts the flow of reading and suggests a lack of basic linguistic competence\par - the language is so broken or the development so slight that the writer's argument is difficult to follow or lacks any sustained logic
