An essay at this level fully accomplishes all of the following:\par - addresses the topic and task with clear, thorough, and well-developed explanations, exemplifications, and details that directly and meaningfully support the position; examples are specific, concrete, fully elaborated, and explicitly connected to the argument - not merely named, vaguely referenced, or superficially mentioned; even \textcolor{rpTypeRule}{if} minor factual inaccuracies exist (\textcolor{rpTypeEvidence}{e.g.}, misspelled names like "Eddison" instead of "Edison"), they do not undermine the logical \textcolor{rpTypeWriting}{coherence} or depth of the analysis\par - is logically organized with strong unity, clear progression, and coherent \textcolor{rpTypeWriting}{transition}s between ideas; no significant \textcolor{rpTypeEvidence}{digression}s, redundancy, or unclear connections exist; structure supports argumentative flow, even \textcolor{rpTypeRule}{if} the conclusion is slightly truncated or implied rather than formally stated\par - displays consistent and effective facility in language use, including syntactic variety and a broad range of precise vocabulary; grammatical, word form, or idiomatic errors are extremely rare, minor, and do not impede clarity, fluency, or meaning in any way - even \textcolor{rpTypeRule}{when} present, they are isolated and do not affect comprehension or flow; \textcolor{rpTypeWriting}{spelling} errors or non-standard word forms (\textcolor{rpTypeEvidence}{e.g.}, "popolation," "essectial") are acceptable \textcolor{rpTypeRule}{if} they are isolated and do not obscure meaning or disrupt the reader's ability to follow the argument\par \par ... [1 lines omitted] ...\par An essay at this level is marked by one or more of the following:\par - addresses the topic and task with partially developed explanations, examples, or details that may be vague, incomplete, repetitive, or only indirectly relevant, but the central position remains discernible; examples may be mentioned but not fully explained, or their connection to the argument is unclear or underdeveloped - however, the writer demonstrates intent to support the claim and the core logic is present, even \textcolor{rpTypeRule}{if} execution is flawed\par - demonstrates adequate but inconsistent \textcolor{rpTypeWriting}{organization}; ideas may be connected in a general way, but \textcolor{rpTypeWriting}{transition}s may be awkward, missing, repetitive, or overly simplistic; there may be some \textcolor{rpTypeEvidence}{digression} or redundancy that disrupts flow, though the overall structure is recognizable and the progression of ideas is discernible\par - shows limited or inconsistent facility in language use: vocabulary may be repetitive, imprecise, or occasionally inappropriate; syntactic structures may be simplistic, faulty, or awkward; and errors in \textcolor{rpTypeWriting}{grammar}, word form, or usage are frequent enough to reduce fluency or occasionally obscure meaning, but the main ideas remain comprehensible despite these flaws - errors are systemic but not so severe as to prevent understanding of the core argument; mis\textcolor{rpTypeWriting}{spelling}s, non-standard phrasing, or awkward constructions (\textcolor{rpTypeEvidence}{e.g.}, "popolation," "it going with the light of the Sun") are tolerated \textcolor{rpTypeRule}{if} the intended meaning can be reasonably inferred without requiring significant reconstruction\par \par ... [1 lines omitted] ...\par An essay at this level is marked by one or more of the following:\par - fails to adequately address the topic or task; response is \textcolor{rpTypeEvidence}{off-topic}, superficial, lacks a clear position, or is largely \textcolor{rpTypeEvidence}{irrelevant}; the writer may appear to misunderstand the prompt or provide no coherent stance\par - demonstrates poor or incoherent \textcolor{rpTypeWriting}{organization}; ideas are disconnected, illogical, or lack any meaningful progression; paragraphs may be absent, randomly structured, or fail to serve a functional purpose\par - provides inadequate, \textcolor{rpTypeEvidence}{irrelevant}, or absent exemplifications, explanations, or details to support claims; any examples given are unelaborated, nonsensical, unrelated, or cut off mid-thought with no discernible intent to develop them\par - exhibits serious and persistent errors in word choice, word form, sentence structure, or usage that frequently obscure meaning, render parts unintelligible, or prevent the reader from following the argument - errors are not isolated but pervasive and systematic, often making comprehension require significant inference beyond what is reasonably possible
