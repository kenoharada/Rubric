\textbf{1. Conditional Gating}\par \textit{What this pattern captures:} Condition-based scoring rules that explicitly branch decisions only when a stated condition is met.\par \textit{Typical cues:} if, when\par \textit{Example 1:} ``... ent but overall meaning is still understandable. - Use \textcolor{pcMatch}{\textbf{when}} the essay demonstrates a clear stance and rudimentary ...''\par \textit{Example 2:} ``... ge: Grammar and usage may prevent comprehension. - Use \textcolor{pcMatch}{\textbf{when}} the essay essentially fails to form an argument or pro ...''\par\vspace{1.2mm}\par \textbf{2. Boundary / Tie-Break Guidance}\par \textit{What this pattern captures:} Rules for resolving borderline cases between adjacent score bands.\par \textit{Typical cues:} tie-break, borderline, boundary, threshold, 4 vs 5\par \textit{Example 1:} ``Revised Scoring Guideline (Version 5 - tightened \textcolor{pcMatch}{\textbf{threshold}} s and quantitative guidance to reduce rater disagreemen ...''\par \textit{Example 2:} ``... pecifics AND strong organization for 6. 7.

Stepwise Rating Workflow}\par \textit{What this pattern captures:} Ordered procedures or checklists for consistent step-by-step scoring.\par \textit{Typical cues:} step, checklist, workflow, procedure, first/second/third\par \textit{Example 1:} ``... hting) 1.

Anti-Mechanical Counting}\par \textit{What this pattern captures:} Rules that reject naive counting and require qualitative judgment.\par \textit{Typical cues:} do not count, not mechanically, do not equate\par \textit{Example 1:} ``... rt the same general reason) strengthen that reason but \textcolor{pcMatch}{\textbf{do not count}} as additional distinct reasons. - To move from 4->5 ...''\par\vspace{1.2mm}\par \textbf{5. Specific Evidence Requirement}\par \textit{What this pattern captures:} Requirements for concrete examples or explicit evidence linkage.\par \textit{Typical cues:} for example, e.g., specific example, illustration, anecdote, evidence\par \textit{Example 1:} ``... oint of view, showing sophisticated critical thinking ( \textcolor{pcMatch}{\textbf{e.g.}} , analyzing tone, diction, or complex contradictions). ...''\par \textit{Example 2:} ``... te but paraphrase-heavy): At least one attempt to link \textcolor{pcMatch}{\textbf{evidence}} to claim is present but explanation is superficial, re ...''\par\vspace{1.2mm}\par \textbf{6. Off-Topic / Summary Cap}\par \textit{What this pattern captures:} Cap-style constraints when responses are off-topic, irrelevant, or summary-only.\par \textit{Typical cues:} off-topic, irrelevant, digression, summary-only, cap\par \textit{Example 1:} ``... s and mechanical-penalty rules (refined \& stricter) 1. \textcolor{pcMatch}{\textbf{Summary-only}} cap (refined): - B = Weak due to summary-only -> MA ...''\par \textit{Example 2:} ``... simple sentence structures - may stray into irrelevant \textcolor{pcMatch}{\textbf{digression}} s, personal anecdotes that provide only tangential supp ...''\par\vspace{1.2mm}\par \textbf{7.

Grammar / Mechanics Signal}\par \textit{What this pattern captures:} Criteria that explicitly evaluate language-form quality.\par \textit{Typical cues:} grammar, mechanics, spelling, punctuation\par \textit{Example 1:} ``... hrase-heavy essay as 4 when development is shallow and \textcolor{pcMatch}{\textbf{mechanics}} are Noticeable. - Fix: If B = Adequate but primarily ...''\par \textit{Example 2:} ``... specific examples. - However, severe breakdowns in \textcolor{pcMatch}{\textbf{grammar}} that impede comprehension of key supports should lower ...''\par\vspace{1.2mm}\par \textbf{9. Repetition Non-Count Rule}\par \textit{What this pattern captures:} Rules that treat repetition/restatement as non-distinct support.\par \textit{Typical cues:} repetition, restatement, double-count, do not double-count\par \textit{Example 1:} ``... l. Long essays with repetition, vagueness, or circular \textcolor{pcMatch}{\textbf{restatement}} of the same point are not sufficient for higher scores ...''\par \textit{Example 2:} ``... tended placeholders-as-evidence as valid "specific". - \textcolor{pcMatch}{\textbf{Do not double-count}} repeated restatements of the same reason.

Quantitative Threshold}\par \textit{What this pattern captures:} Numeric cutoffs used to make decisions more consistent.\par \textit{Typical cues:} at least, at most, <=, >=, \%, N reasons/examples/sentences/words\par \textit{Example 1:} ``... ast 2 distinct reasons each with at least min-elab AND \textcolor{pcMatch}{\textbf{at least}} one clear specific example supporting any one of the r ...''\par \textit{Example 2:} ``... rescue very shallow content. - Fix: B and A must be \textcolor{pcMatch}{\textbf{at least}} Adequate for score >= 4.
